It can be thing as mix of ZSpheres with Metaballs, combining best of both worlds. I wanted this kind of workflow to be possible for long time. Your browser does not support the video tag. Add-on requires Blender 3.3 or above (at the moment Blender 3.3 is still beta, may be unstable). Features list: \u00b6 Model your characters using two primitives: Sphere and Round cone Blobs Auto-generated hierarchy of objects (rig like) is created, when adding new Blob Blobs blending control that allows to get organic results One click Symmetrical setup, Easy to use: extrude, subdivide, connect and duplicate is all you need to model One click Armature generation Video Tutorial \u00b6 Add-on support channel Installation \u00b6 To install Blob Fusion you need zip file from your Gumroad account. Then, inside Blender, go to: Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons, and click ' Install ' button. And navigate to BlobFusion.x.zip file location. Updating \u00b6 Blob Fusion has build in auto updater. When you use it, updater will download latest Blob Fusion release and install in background. To use auto updater go to: Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons -> Blob Fusion -> press 'Check for update'. In new version is found, press ' Update add-on ' button, wait few seconds for download, installation and restart blender. Or you download update manually by getting new zip file from your Gumroad account. You should have received download link to zip file, with email when you purchased Blob Fusion. Note - Sometimes I upload smaller, incremental updates, without version bump. In that case, even if you have the latest version of Blob Fusion, you may try to update anyway - using Reinstall Current Version Support \u00b6 For support or bug reports use this discord server .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#blob-fusion","text":"","title":"Blob Fusion"},{"location":"#blob-fusion-documentation","text":"Blob Fusion is Blender add-on targeted for character/creature basemeshes creation.

Divide only works on Capsule Blobs Your browser does not support the video tag. Duplicate, Extrued and Subdivide Blobs are the core commands for modeling with Blob Fusion Free Move vs FK \u00b6 When you create Blobs, add-on will automatically generate a child - parent relationships.
