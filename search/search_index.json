Blob Fusion \u00b6 Blob Fusion is add-on for Blender 3.6 and 4.x, targeted for base-meshes creation. It can be thought as mix of ZSpheres with Metaballs (Signed Distance Fields), combining best of both worlds. I wished for this kind of workflow being possible, for quite some time. Your browser does not support the video tag. Features \u00b6 Model your characters using two primitives: Sphere and Round cone Blobs Auto-generated hierarchy of objects (rig like) is created, when adding new Blob Library of presets for quick start (human, animal, etc.), Blobs blending control that allows to get organic results One click Symmetrical setup, Easy to use: extrude, subdivide, connect and duplicate is all you need to model One click Armature generation Video Tutorial \u00b6 Blob Fusion 1.0 release video where basics of blobs modeling are shown (extruding, subdividing, connecting, duplicating blobs etc.) Blob Fusion 1.5 Update video where I show new Dynamic Bounding Box and library of presets features Installation \u00b6 To install Blob Fusion you need zip file from your Gumroad account. Then, inside Blender, go to: Edit > Preferences > Add-ons, and click ' Install ' button. And navigate to BlobFusion.x.zip file location. Updating \u00b6 Blob Fusion has build in auto updater. When you use it, updater will download latest Blob Fusion release and install in background. To use auto updater go to: Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons -> Blob Fusion -> press 'Check for update'. In new version is found, press ' Update add-on ' button, wait few seconds for download, installation and restart blender. Or you download update manually by getting new zip file from your Gumroad account. You should have received download link to zip file, with email when you purchased Blob Fusion. Note - Sometimes I upload smaller, incremental updates, without version bump. In that case, even if you have the latest version of Blob Fusion, you may try to update anyway - using Reinstall Current Version Extension \u00b6 Since version 1.6+ Blob Fusing supports only Blender 4.2+ . It was also converted from addon to Extension , which is a new way of handling add-ons in Blender 4.2. Blob Fusion continues to use custom 'old' auto-updater (I may switch to Blender extension updater in future). There is one issue though , if you update old BFusion 1.5.x add-on to new 1.6+ Extension , using built-in auto-updater, the new extension will stay in same ./addons/ folder (auto-updater only updates the files - it does not move them around to different folders). THE FIX: After auto-updating move BFusion 1.6 Extension from: ./blender/4.2/scripts/addons/ folder to blender/4.2/extensions/user_default/ Note - Info where to find yours addons folder (it depends on your OS), can be found here OR: Remove Blob Fusion 1.5.x add-on, and then install new Blob Fusion 1.6+ Extension from zip file - like it is explained in Blender Docs . You will have to grab the extension zip file from your Gumroad account.
